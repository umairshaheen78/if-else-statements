 5 // 2 = 2
 5 % 1 = 1
 9 % 10 = 9

2. Assignment Operators
= assignment 

 += Addition Assignment
 -= Subtraction Assignment
 *= Multiply Assignment

 Rule: 
 a += 4 >> a = a + 4 

3. Comparison Operators
 == equal to
 != not equal to
 < less than
 <= less than or equal to
 > greater then
 >= greater than or equal to
